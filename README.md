# Marlin_SKR2_MPCNC_2209_DUAL
Firmware build for MPCNC with SKR2 Controller board, TFT35 v3, TMC2209 stepper drivers and Dual Endstops.


This is a work in progress, no warranty, support or guarantee this won't make something go wrong! :)


At the root directory, we have the MarlinBuilder folder.
This is a copy of the folder from 'MarlinBuilder' by Adam at V1 engineering.
I have modified files in the src folder within to add configurations for the SKR 2.

The Marlin Folder is a clone of the marlin repo from around 10/6/21.

The 'firmware.bin' file at the root of Marlinbuilder is the most recent firmware I've built. 
At this stage, it is untested. It powers on and runs the screen, and the stepper motors move.
That's as far as I've got it so far.

Feel free to fork, make changes, etc. But please raise merge resuests for your changes so we can work on it together and make a nice firmware for SKR2 users!


Cheers,
Ben.
